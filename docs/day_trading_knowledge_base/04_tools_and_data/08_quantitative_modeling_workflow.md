# [CONCEPT: Quant_Modeling] The Quantitative Trading Model Development Lifecycle

This document provides a methodological guide for the AI agent's research and development module. It codifies the rigorous, systematic lifecycle required to create and validate new, proprietary alpha signals.

### [LIFECYCLE: Stage_1] Stage 1: Predictive Feature Engineering

This is the process of transforming raw, non-stationary market data into informative, predictive signals (features) that a machine learning model can use.

- **[FEATURE: Price_Transformation] Logarithmic Returns:** Raw prices are non-stationary. Log returns (`ln(Price_t / Price_t-1)`) are the standard for quantitative modeling because they are time-additive and approximately normally distributed, which is a core assumption for many statistical techniques.
- **[FEATURE: Momentum] Rate of Change (ROC):** A pure momentum oscillator that measures the percentage price change over a lookback period. Useful for capturing trend and momentum.
- **[FEATURE: Volatility] Historical Volatility (HV):** The annualized standard deviation of log returns. A critical feature for identifying market regimes (high vs. low volatility) and as an input for risk management.
- **[FEATURE: Microstructure] Order Flow Imbalance (OFI):** A highly predictive, short-term feature calculated from tick data. It measures the net pressure from aggressive buy and sell orders and is a direct, causal driver of price movement.

### [LIFECYCLE: Stage_2] Stage 2: A Decision Framework for Model Selection

The choice of model involves a trade-off between interpretability, complexity, and performance.

| [MODEL: Criterion] | [MODEL_TYPE: Statistical (ARIMA)] | [MODEL_TYPE: Tree-Based (XGBoost/LGBM)] | [MODEL_TYPE: Deep_Learning (LSTM)] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Assumptions** | Requires stationarity; assumes linear relationships. | Agnostic to data distribution; no linearity assumption. | Agnostic to data distribution. |
| **Handling Non-linearity**| Poor. Fundamentally a linear model. | **Excellent.** Natively captures complex feature interactions. | **Excellent.** Can approximate any function. |
| **Interpretability** | **High.** Parameters have clear statistical meaning. | **Medium.** Provides feature importance scores. | **Low.** A "black box." |
| **Computational Cost** | Low. | Medium. | **Very High.** Requires GPUs and significant time. |
| **Data Requirements** | Can work with small datasets. | Works best with medium to large structured datasets. | **Requires very large datasets** to avoid overfitting. |
| **Native Time Handling** | **Excellent.** Designed for time-series. | None. Requires manual engineering of lag features. | **Excellent.** Architecturally designed for sequences. |
| **Primary Use Case** | Baseline modeling for linear patterns. | **The Workhorse.** High-performance prediction on structured/tabular features. | Complex sequence modeling where order is critical (e.g., LOB data). |

### [LIFECYCLE: Stage_3] Stage 3: Data Hygiene and Leakage Prevention

This is a set of non-negotiable protocols to ensure the integrity of the backtest.

- **[RULE: Chronological_Split]** The dataset **must** be split into training, validation, and test sets based on time. Random shuffling is a fatal error for time-series data.
- **[RULE: Quarantine_Test_Set]** The test set must be completely isolated and used only **once** for the final evaluation of the single, chosen model. Reusing the test set invalidates the results.
- **[RULE: Fit_on_Train_Only]** Any data preprocessor (e.g., StandardScaler) must be `.fit()` **only** on the training data and then `.transform()` the validation and test data.
- **[RULE: Prevent_Look_Ahead]** All feature calculations must be causal. A feature at time `t` can only use information available at or before `t`.

### [LIFECYCLE: Stage_4] Stage 4: Robust Hyperparameter Optimization

- **[TECHNIQUE: Search_Methods]** For tuning model hyperparameters, **Bayesian Optimization** is superior to Grid Search or Randomized Search as it is more sample-efficient, making it ideal for computationally expensive financial backtests.
- **[TECHNIQUE: WFO] The Gold Standard: Walk-Forward Optimization (WFO):** This is the only acceptable validation framework for non-stationary financial markets. It simulates real-world adaptation by repeatedly optimizing the model on a rolling "in-sample" window and testing it on the next "out-of-sample" window. The final result is a concatenation of all out-of-sample periods, providing a robust estimate of live performance.
