# [CONCEPT: Alternative_Data] Quantifying Geopolitical Risk

This document outlines a methodology for transforming qualitative geopolitical events into a quantitative risk score that can be used as an input for trading models. This allows the agent to systematically account for market-wide risk that is not specific to a single company's fundamentals.

## 1. The GPR Index: An Academic Foundation

The foundational methodology for this task is the Caldara and Iacoviello Geopolitical Risk (GPR) Index. It works by scanning the text of major newspapers for keywords related to geopolitical threats and adverse events. The index is calculated as the monthly share of articles that contain these keywords.

This provides a robust, low-frequency measure of perceived global risk.

## 2. Creating a Custom, High-Frequency GPR Score

For day trading, a monthly index is too slow. We can adapt the GPR methodology to create our own high-frequency risk score using our real-time EODHD news feed.

- **Data Source:** EODHD Financial News API.
- **Methodology:**
    1. **Relevance Filtering:** Create a dictionary of keywords related to geopolitical risk (e.g., `sanctions`, `trade dispute`, `military`, `unrest`, `election`). The agent will scan all incoming news headlines for these keywords to filter for relevant articles.
    2. **Sentiment Analysis:** For each relevant article, use an NLP model (like FinBERT) to calculate a sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral).
    3. **Scoring:** An individual `ArticleRiskScore` can be calculated as `Relevance * abs(Negative_Sentiment)`. The absolute value is used because even "positive" news about a conflict (e.g., a "successful" military strike) represents elevated risk.
    4. **Aggregation:** The final, high-frequency GPR score is the **Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the `ArticleRiskScore`** over a rolling time window (e.g., 1-hour). This gives more weight to the most recent news, making the score highly reactive.

## 3. Commercial Data Providers

While a custom index is powerful, several commercial providers offer more sophisticated, expert-driven geopolitical data. These can be considered as supplementary "edge-enhancing" data sources.

- **BMI (GeoQuant):** A leading provider that uses a hybrid model combining AI with human political scientists to generate high-frequency, back-testable risk data for over 140 countries.
- **Eurasia Group:** A top-tier consultancy known for its qualitative, expert-driven analysis and forward-looking reports on major geopolitical trends.
- **Verisk Maplecroft:** Offers over 190 global risk indices, with a strong focus on integrating ESG and subnational political risk, which is valuable for analyzing companies with complex global supply chains.

## 4. ADK Implementation

The custom GPR score can be generated by a `FunctionTool` within the `MarketRegimeSubPipeline`. This score would then be added to the `MarketRegimeState` object, making it available to all downstream agents and models as a key feature for risk management and strategy selection.
