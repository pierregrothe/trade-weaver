# [CONCEPT: Alternative_Data] Using Supply Chain Data for Predictive Analytics

This document explores the use of supply chain data as a powerful source of alternative data for gaining a predictive edge in financial markets. By analyzing the physical movement of goods, it is possible to develop leading indicators of corporate performance and economic trends long before official numbers are released.

## 1. The Alpha in Supply Chain Data

The global supply chain is a complex network of relationships between suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, and customers. Data generated from this network provides a ground-truth view of economic activity. For a trading agent, analyzing this data can reveal:

- **Revenue & Earnings Surprises:** Tracking a retailer's import volumes can provide an early signal of its quarterly sales figures.
- **Production Bottlenecks:** Identifying disruptions at a key supplier can help predict production issues for a downstream company.
- **Competitive Shifts:** Analyzing shifts in shipping volume between two competitors can indicate changes in market share.

This is a highly specialized data category that is **not available** through standard brokers or foundational data providers like EODHD. It requires subscriptions to specialist vendors.

## 2. Primary Types of Supply Chain Data

- **Bills of Lading / Shipping Manifests:** Documents containing details of a shipment, including the shipper, consignee, vessel name, container numbers, and a description of the goods. This is one of the most valuable data types.
- **Geolocation Data (AIS):** Real-time tracking data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS) of maritime vessels.
- **Customs Data:** Government-collected data on imports and exports.
- **Sensor & IoT Data:** Real-time information from sensors on shipping containers or warehouses, tracking things like temperature, humidity, and location.

## 3. Leading Data Providers

- **Bloomberg / Refinitiv (LSEG):** Offer comprehensive supply chain relationship data, mapping out the customers, suppliers, and partners of global companies.
- **S&P Global Supply Chain Console:** Provides a platform integrating trade, pricing, and country risk data with over 2 billion shipment records.
- **Sedex:** Focuses on ethical and sustainable supply chain data, which is crucial for ESG-focused risk analysis.

## 4. ADK Implementation: Hypothetical `FunctionTool`

This example outlines a hypothetical `FunctionTool` that could process shipping manifest data to create a predictive feature for a retailer's quarterly revenue.

### Python Example: `generate_revenue_forecast_from_shipping_data`

```python
# [TOOL_CODE: generate_revenue_forecast_from_shipping_data]
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Assume this function loads data from a specialized provider like S&P Global
def load_shipping_manifest_data(ticker: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Simulates loading historical shipping data for a given company."""
    # In a real scenario, this would involve an API call to a provider.
    # This sample data shows the total value of goods shipped per month.
    data = {
        'date': pd.to_datetime([
            '2024-01-31', '2024-02-29', '2024-03-31', '2024-04-30', 
            '2024-05-31', '2024-06-30', '2024-07-31', '2024-08-31'
        ]),
        'shipped_value_usd': [1.5e9, 1.6e9, 1.7e9, 1.8e9, 1.75e9, 1.85e9, 1.9e9, 2.0e9],
        'quarterly_revenue_usd': [4.8e9, 4.8e9, 4.8e9, 5.4e9, 5.4e9, 5.4e9, None, None]
    }
    return pd.DataFrame(data).set_index('date')

def generate_revenue_forecast_from_shipping_data(tool_context: ToolContext, ticker: str) -> dict:
    """Analyzes historical shipping data to forecast next quarter's revenue."""
    
    df = load_shipping_manifest_data(ticker)
    
    # 1. Feature Engineering: Aggregate monthly shipping data into quarterly data
    df_quarterly = df.resample('Q').sum()
    
    # 2. Create lagged features for the model
    # We want to predict next quarter's revenue based on this quarter's shipping value
    df_quarterly['shipped_value_lag1'] = df_quarterly['shipped_value_usd'].shift(1)
    df_quarterly = df_quarterly.dropna()

    # 3. Train a simple predictive model
    X = df_quarterly[['shipped_value_lag1']]
    y = df_quarterly['quarterly_revenue_usd']
    
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)
    
    # 4. Make a prediction for the next quarter
    last_known_shipping_quarter = df.resample('Q').sum().iloc[-1:]
    next_quarter_forecast = model.predict(last_known_shipping_quarter[['shipped_value_usd']])
    
    return {
        "ticker": ticker,
        "forecasted_next_quarter_revenue_usd": next_quarter_forecast[0],
        "based_on_last_quarter_shipping_value_usd": last_known_shipping_quarter['shipped_value_usd'].iloc[0]
    }
```
