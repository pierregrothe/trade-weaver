# [DATA_PROVIDER: EODHD] In-Depth Analysis of EODHD

EOD Historical Data (EODHD) is a comprehensive data provider with significant strengths in data consolidation and developer support, making it a strong candidate for an agentic AI trading platform.

### [CONCEPT: Primary_Recommendation] Primary Recommendation Justification (Ranked)

The primary recommendation is to select the **EODHD "All-In-One" plan**. This decision is based on the following key factors, ranked by importance for an agentic AI system:

1. **[FACTOR: Architectural_Simplification] Architectural Simplification:** EODHD's greatest strength is its consolidated, single-API model. This dramatically reduces development time, integration complexity, and long-term maintenance overhead.
2. **[FACTOR: Total_Cost_of_Ownership] Superior Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** At ~$99/month, the "All-In-One" plan provides a feature set that would cost 2-5 times more to assemble from competitors.
3. **[FACTOR: Data_Breadth] Comprehensive Data for Agentic AI:** The platform provides the full spectrum of data needed for an AI to build a "world model" of the market.
4. **[FACTOR: Developer_Tooling] Mature Developer Tooling:** The provision of an official, actively maintained **asynchronous Python client (`eodhdc`)** is a critical feature that directly aligns with a high-performance, non-blocking architecture.

### [DATA: Market_Data] Market Data Feeds

- **[FEATURE: End_of_Day_EOD]** Excellent. Over 30 years of history for many US assets, crucial for long-term backtesting. Data is properly adjusted for splits and dividends.
- **[FEATURE: Intraday_Historical]** Sufficient. Provides 1-minute bars back to 2004 for US markets.
- **[FEATURE: Real_Time_WebSockets]** Viable. The "Real-Time" API, delivered via **WebSockets** with ~50ms latency, meets the "day trading" requirement. This is only available in the premium "All-In-One" plan.
- **[WARNING: Delayed_Data]** The "Live (Delayed)" API is **unsuitable** for trading due to a 15-20 minute delay.
- **[FEATURE: Bulk_API]** A standout feature that allows downloading data for an entire exchange via a single API call, massively simplifying database seeding.

### [CONCEPT: ADK_Implementation] ADK Implementation Note

- The `eodhdc` Python library's support for asynchronous operations is a perfect match for the target architecture. The data ingestion module, deployed as a GCP Cloud Run service, should be written using Python's `asyncio` library. The ingested data can be passed to an ADK `LlmAgent` through a custom `FunctionTool` that subscribes to the GCP Pub/Sub topic where the data is published.

### [CONCEPT: Limitations] Limitations and Data Gaps

While EODHD is an excellent foundational provider, it is critical to understand its limitations. EODHD provides **Level 1** data (top-of-book quotes and trades). It does **not** currently provide the **Level 2 (aggregated market depth) or Level 3 (market-by-order) data** necessary for the most advanced order flow analysis, such as calculating the `Order_Imbalance_Score` or the order flow components of the `Chart_Clarity_Score`. This necessitates a hybrid data strategy, supplementing EODHD with a specialized Level 2/3 data provider.
