# AI Day Trading Agent Knowledge Base

This repository contains the structured, multi-document knowledge base for an advanced AI Day Trading Agent. The information has been synthesized from multiple sources and organized into a semantically coherent structure, optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this knowledge base is to serve as the single source of truth for an AI agent, providing comprehensive and detailed information on all aspects of day trading, including:

- Foundational principles and risk management
- Operational playbooks and daily routines
- Specific trading strategies
- Tools, data feeds, and technical indicators
- Regulatory and fiscal rules for the US and Canada (with a focus on Qu√©bec)
- Brokerage platform analysis
- AI-specific development challenges like backtesting and system architecture

## Structure

The knowledge base is organized into logical directories, each focusing on a core domain of day trading. A central `manifest.json` file provides a machine-readable index of all documents, their descriptions, and keywords to aid the retrieval system.

Each document uses Markdown for structure and is enhanced with metadata tags (e.g., `[CONCEPT: ...]`, `[RULE: ...]`) to provide clear signals to the AI about the nature of the information.
