# [BROKER: Questrade] Deep Dive: Questrade

Questrade is a leading independent Canadian broker known for its accessible platforms and competitive pricing for a broad range of investors. It is regulated by **[REGULATOR: CIRO]**.

### [CONCEPT: Target_Audience] Target Audience and Philosophy

- **[PROFILE: Accessible_Powerhouse]** Questrade serves a wide spectrum of investors, from beginners to active traders. Its platforms are designed to be more accessible and less intimidating than professional-grade alternatives.

### [API: Questrade] API Access

- **[API: RESTful]** Questrade offers a single, modern RESTful API using the OAuth 2.0 framework. It provides access to account data, market data, and order placement.
- **[API: Documentation]** Official API documentation is available, and an active developer community exists.
- **[API: Paper_Trading]** A "practice server" is accessible via the API, allowing for AI agent training. The documented fidelity of this simulation is less extensive than IBKR's.

### [CONCEPT: Cost_Structure] Cost Structure and Fees

- **[COMMISSIONS: Zero_Commission_Model]** Questrade's primary appeal is its **$0 commission** model for online stock and ETF trades.
- **[FEE: ECN_Fees] The ECN Fee Reality:** This is a critical caveat. **Electronic Communication Network (ECN) fees** may still apply on orders that *remove liquidity* (e.g., market orders). For a day trading agent that prioritizes speed, these fees can accumulate and act as the *de facto* commission, making the "zero commission" claim misleading for this use case.
- **[CURRENCY_CONVERSION: High_Cost]** This is a **major architectural drawback** for agents trading U.S. markets. Questrade charges a high fee for currency conversion, typically around **1.5%**, which is built into the exchange rate. This can severely impact profitability for an active cross-border strategy.
- **[MARGIN_RATES: Moderate_Cost]** Margin interest rates are significantly higher than IBKR's.

### [PLATFORM: Edge] Trading Platform: Questrade Edge Suite

- **[STRENGTH: User_Friendly]** The Edge suite of platforms (Web, Desktop) are widely regarded as more intuitive and easier to learn than IBKR's TWS.
- **[STRENGTH: Essential_Tools]** The platforms provide essential tools for day traders, including advanced order types like bracket and conditional orders.

### [CONCEPT: AI_Assessment] AI Agent-Specific Assessment

- **[CRITERIA_RANK: 1 - API Access]** **Good.** Provides a modern, functional REST API with a practice environment. It is suitable for wrapping in an ADK `FunctionTool`.
- **[CRITERIA_RANK: 2 - Regulatory]** **Excellent for Undercapitalized Agents.** Questrade **does not enforce the U.S. PDT rule** on its Canadian clients. This makes it the **primary viable option** for an AI agent with < $25,000 USD in capital that needs to trade U.S. markets.
- **[CRITERIA_RANK: 3 - Costs]** **Poor for Cross-Border Trading.** The high **1.5% currency conversion fee** is a major deterrent for any strategy involving frequent trading of U.S. stocks. The ambiguity of ECN fees also complicates profitability modeling.
- **[RECOMMENDATION]** Questrade is the **recommended starting point for under-capitalized Canadian-based AI agents** that must trade U.S. stocks, due to its non-enforcement of the PDT rule. However, the agent's financial model **must** account for the high currency conversion fees, and a strategy of maintaining a separate USD cash balance is mandatory to mitigate this cost. For well-capitalized agents, the cost structure is significantly less favorable than IBKR's.
