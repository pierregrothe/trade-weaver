# [JURISDICTION: Canada] Canadian Regulatory Framework

This document explains the regulatory environment for day traders in Canada, governed by the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) and provincial bodies like Québec's Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF).

### [REGULATOR: CIRO_and_AMF] Key Authorities

- **[REGULATOR: CIRO] (Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization):** The national self-regulatory body that establishes rules for brokerage firms. CIRO rules cover margin, account handling, and order execution. CIRO member firms are protected by the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF).
- **[REGULATOR: AMF] (Autorité des marchés financiers):** The provincial securities regulator for Québec, focused on investor protection and market efficiency.

### [RULE: No_PDT_Rule_in_Canada] The Canadian Advantage: No Domestic PDT Rule

- **[PRINCIPLE: No_Equivalent_Rule]** Canadian securities regulators **do not have a domestic equivalent** of the U.S. FINRA Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule.
- **[APPLICATION: Canadian_Markets]** A trader using a Canadian-regulated brokerage to trade securities listed exclusively on **Canadian exchanges** (e.g., TSX) is **not** subject to a specific minimum account balance based on the frequency of their day trades.

### [RULE: PDT_Exception_Canada] The Critical Exception for U.S. Markets

- **[PRINCIPLE: Cross_Border_Jurisdiction]** Certain Canadian brokers, most notably **Interactive Brokers Canada (IBKR)**, **apply the U.S. PDT rule** to their Canadian clients who trade U.S.-listed securities. This is because they clear these trades through a U.S. affiliate, bringing the transactions under SEC/FINRA jurisdiction.
- **[CONSEQUENCE: Capital_Requirement]** A Canadian trader using IBKR to actively day trade U.S. stocks **must maintain a minimum equity of US$25,000**.
- **[STRATEGIC_IMPLICATION: Broker_Choice]** This makes broker selection critical. An under-capitalized Canadian trader wishing to trade U.S. stocks must choose a broker like **Questrade**, which does not appear to enforce this rule.

### [RULE: Account_Types] Critical Rules for Account Types

- **[ACCOUNT: Margin] Margin Account (Required):** This is the **required** account type for professional day trading. It allows for leverage and short selling, and crucially, provides immediate access to capital from closed trades without waiting for settlement.
- **[ACCOUNT: Registered] Registered Accounts (TFSA/RRSP) - Prohibited:**
  - **[RISK: Compliance_Violation]** Attempting to day trade within a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) or a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is a significant compliance risk. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) explicitly prohibits **carrying on a business** within these accounts.
  - **[CONSEQUENCE: Tax_Penalties]** If trading activity is deemed frequent and systematic, the CRA can revoke the account's tax-sheltered status, making all gains fully taxable as business income and imposing potential penalties.
- **[ACCOUNT: Cash] Cash Accounts - Unsuitable:**
  - **[RISK: Free_Riding_Violation]** In a cash account, funds from a sale are not available for reuse until the trade officially settles (T+1). Using unsettled funds to enter a new position is a violation known as "free riding."
  - **[CONSEQUENCE: Infeasibility]** The T+1 settlement cycle makes the rapid buying and selling required for day trading impossible.
