# [CONCEPT: ML_for_Trading] Overview of Machine Learning in Trading

This document provides a high-level overview of the primary machine learning (ML) models and techniques applicable to quantitative trading. The goal is to move beyond static, rule-based systems to adaptive models that can learn from and identify complex patterns in market data.

### [CONCEPT: Model_Categories] Categories of Machine Learning Models

Machine learning models for trading can be broadly categorized into three groups:

1.  **Time-Series Models:** These are classical statistical models specifically designed to analyze and forecast time-ordered data points.
    -   **[MODEL: ARIMA]** AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average: A robust model for capturing linear trends and seasonality in data.
    -   **[MODEL: Prophet]** Developed by Facebook, this model is adept at handling time-series data with strong seasonal patterns and missing data points.

2.  **Classical Machine Learning Models:** These models are effective at finding relationships between a target variable (like future price) and a set of input features.
    -   **[MODEL: Linear_Regression]** A simple model for establishing a linear relationship between price and other variables.
    -   **[MODEL: SVM]** Support Vector Machines: Can be used for both classification (predicting price direction) and regression (predicting a price value).
    -   **[MODEL: Random_Forest]** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and is effective for large, structured datasets.

3.  **Deep Learning Models:** These are advanced neural networks capable of capturing highly complex, non-linear patterns in vast datasets.
    -   **[MODEL: LSTM]** Long Short-Term Memory: A specialized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excels at learning from sequential data, making it one of the most powerful and widely used models for time-series forecasting.
    -   **[MODEL: GRU]** Gated Recurrent Units: Similar to LSTMs but with a simpler architecture, also effective for capturing long-term dependencies.

### [CONCEPT: AI_Paradigm_Shift] The AI Paradigm Shift in Trading

The introduction of advanced AI techniques represents a paradigm shift from signal generation to holistic strategy development:

-   **[PARADIGM: Predictive_Modeling] Predictive Modeling:** Using models like LSTMs to forecast future price movements based on historical data and technical indicators.
-   **[PARADIGM: Sentiment_Analysis] Sentiment Analysis:** Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) models like **FinBERT** to analyze news, social media, and filings to generate a quantifiable sentiment score, providing an edge in catalyst-driven trades.
-   **[PARADIGM: Reinforcement_Learning] Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Training an AI agent to learn an optimal trading policy through trial and error in a simulated market environment. This is a powerful technique for creating adaptive strategies that can respond to changing market conditions.

### [CONCEPT: Critical_Considerations] Critical Considerations for ML in Trading

-   **[RISK: Overfitting]** The single greatest risk is creating a model that performs exceptionally well on historical data but fails in live trading. Rigorous backtesting and validation techniques, such as walk-forward analysis, are essential to mitigate this.
-   **[REQUIREMENT: Data_Quality]** All ML models are dependent on high-quality, clean data. The agent's data ingestion and validation pipeline is a critical prerequisite for success.
-   **[REQUIREMENT: Feature_Engineering]** The predictive power of a model is heavily influenced by the quality of its input features. This includes not just price data but also trading volume, technical indicators, and alternative data like sentiment scores.
