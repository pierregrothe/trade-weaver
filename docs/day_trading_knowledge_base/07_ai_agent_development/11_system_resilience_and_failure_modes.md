# [CONCEPT: System_Resilience] System Resilience and Failure Modes

This document outlines the critical protocols for handling technical and operational risk. A profitable trading strategy is irrelevant if the system executing it is not resilient to real-world failures. This is not about market risk, but the risk of the system itself failing.

### [PRINCIPLE: Importance] The Importance of System Resilience

In algorithmic trading, failures in connectivity, data feeds, or broker APIs can lead to significant financial loss. A resilient system is designed to anticipate these failures and handle them gracefully, with a focus on preserving capital and maintaining a known state at all times.

### [CATEGORY: Failure_Modes] Common Failure Modes and Protocols

#### 1. Loss of Internet Connectivity

-   **[RISK]** The agent loses its connection to the outside world. It cannot receive new market data or send new orders.
-   **[PROTOCOL: Heartbeat_System]** The agent must implement a "heartbeat" system. It will ping a reliable external service (e.g., a Google server) every few seconds. If the heartbeat fails for a configurable period (e.g., 10 seconds), the agent must assume a loss of connectivity.
-   **[PROTOCOL: Automated_Shutdown]** Upon detecting a loss of connectivity, the agent must immediately enter a **"safe mode."** It will cease all new signal generation and, if possible, send a final command to the broker to cancel all open orders to prevent them from being filled without the agent's supervision.

#### 2. Broker API Downtime or Errors

-   **[RISK]** The broker's API becomes unavailable or starts returning errors. The agent can no longer place or manage trades.
-   **[PROTOCOL: API_Resilience_Patterns]** The agent's API interaction module must implement the following patterns:
    -   **[PATTERN: Exponential_Backoff]** For transient errors (e.g., HTTP 503), the agent must not spam the API with retries. It must use an exponential backoff algorithm, waiting for progressively longer, randomized intervals before retrying.
    -   **[PATTERN: Circuit_Breaker]** If a specific API endpoint fails consistently (e.g., 5 consecutive failures), the circuit breaker pattern must be engaged. The agent will stop trying to call that endpoint for a configurable cool-down period, preventing cascading failures.
-   **[PROTOCOL: Alerting]** Any engagement of the circuit breaker must trigger a high-priority alert to the human operator.

#### 3. Data Feed Corruption or Delays

-   **[RISK]** The real-time data feed becomes corrupted, delayed, or stops entirely. The agent might make decisions based on stale or incorrect data.
-   **[PROTOCOL: Timestamp_Validation]** The agent must check the timestamp of every incoming data packet. If the timestamp is older than a specified tolerance (e.g., 500 milliseconds), the data is considered stale, and the agent should not act on it.
-   **[PROTOCOL: Redundant_Data_Feeds]** For critical data like real-time pricing, the system should be designed to ingest data from a secondary source (e.g., using the IBKR real-time data feed as a backup to the EODHD feed). If the primary feed becomes stale, the system can automatically switch to the secondary feed.

### [CONCEPT: ADK_Implementation] ADK Implementation Pattern

-   **[ARCHITECTURE]** The resilience protocols should be implemented as a series of **ADK Callbacks** on the root agent.
    -   A `before_agent_callback` can implement the heartbeat check, blocking the agent's execution if connectivity is lost.
    -   A `before_tool_callback` can wrap all calls to the broker API, implementing the exponential backoff and circuit breaker patterns.
-   **[MONITORING]** A separate monitoring service should be created to track the health of all system components. This service will be responsible for sending alerts to the human operator in case of any failures.
