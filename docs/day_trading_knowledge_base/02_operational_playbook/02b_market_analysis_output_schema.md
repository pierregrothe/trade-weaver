# [CONCEPT: Market_Analysis_Output] Market Analysis Report: JSON Output Schema

## 1. Document Purpose and Design Philosophy

This document provides the definitive, canonical schema for the `MarketAnalysisReport` JSON object. This object is the terminal output of the **Market Analyst Agent** and serves as the primary data input for any downstream consumer, such as a **Strategy & Execution Agent**.

This schema is designed to be a pure, objective data report. It provides raw, quantitative metrics and avoids interpretive states (e.g., "High Volatility"). This grants the consuming agent maximum flexibility to apply its own proprietary logic, user-configured thresholds, and strategy-selection models. It also includes metadata to ensure data provenance and aid in debugging and versioning.

## 2. Top-Level JSON Structure

The root of the report is a JSON object containing metadata about the analysis run and an array of exchange-specific reports.

```json
{
  "report_id": "string (UUID)",
  "analysis_timestamp_utc": "string (ISO 8601)",
  "schema_version": "string (SemVer e.g., 1.1.0)",
  "run_type": "string (Enum: Pre-Market, Intraday_Open, Intraday_Midday)",
  "exchange_reports": [
    { ... }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Detailed Field Breakdown

### 3.1. Root Object

| JSON Field (Path) | Data Type | Description & Rationale | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`report_id`** | `string` | A unique identifier (UUID) for the entire analysis run. Critical for logging, tracing, and idempotency. | Agent Runtime Generation |
| **`analysis_timestamp_utc`**| `string` | The ISO 8601 timestamp for when the analysis was completed. | Agent Runtime Generation |
| **`schema_version`** | `string` | The semantic version of this schema. Crucial for preventing parsing errors in downstream consumers if the schema evolves. | Static Configuration |
| **`run_type`** | `string` | An enum indicating the context of the analysis run (`Pre-Market`, `Intraday_Open`, `Intraday_Midday`). | Initial Request Payload |
| **`exchange_reports`** | `array` | The main data container. Each object in this array is a complete report for a single exchange. | - |

### 3.2. Exchange Report Object (`exchange_reports[]`)

| `observed_instruments` | `array` | An array of all instruments on this exchange that were identified and enriched. | - |

### 3.3. Observed Instrument Object (`observed_instruments[]`)

This object contains all the enriched data for a single financial instrument.
