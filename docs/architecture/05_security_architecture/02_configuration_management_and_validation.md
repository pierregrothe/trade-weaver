# Configuration Management and Validation

This document defines the secure, auditable, and robust process for managing and deploying changes to the agent's configuration, as decided in ADR-0015. This process treats configuration changes with the same rigor as code changes to prevent financial loss from misconfiguration.

## 1. The Challenge

The trading agent's behavior is heavily dependent on a complex set of parameters stored in the `AgentConfigurations` and `Strategies` Firestore collections. A single incorrect change to a risk parameter, strategy setting, or model threshold could lead to significant financial loss.

## 2. The Solution: A Git-Based Validation Lifecycle

All configuration changes are managed through a formalized, CI/CD-based **Configuration Validation Lifecycle**. This approach treats configuration as code (Infrastructure as Code).

### The Unified Configuration Validation Lifecycle

1. **Initiation (Request for Change):** A developer proposes a change by creating a pull request against a version-controlled repository containing the configuration files (e.g., in JSON or YAML format).

2. **Static Validation:** The CI/CD pipeline automatically triggers static analysis to check for syntax errors, schema violations, and basic rule validation (e.g., ensuring a percentage is between 0 and 100).

3. **Peer & Risk Review (Four-Eyes Principle):** The pull request must be reviewed and approved by at least one other qualified team member. Changes to critical risk parameters must also receive a formal, auditable sign-off from a designated risk manager.

4. **Automated Impact Analysis (The Gauntlet):** Upon approval, the pipeline executes a series of automated tests:
    * **Automated Backtesting:** A comparative backtest is run using the new configuration against the old one on recent historical data (e.g., last 90 days). The system generates a report showing the delta in P&L, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.
    * **"What-If" Scenario Analysis:** The new configuration is tested against a set of predefined scenarios (e.g., market volatility +50%, correlation breakdowns) to assess its robustness.

5. **Live Simulation (Paper Trading):** If the gauntlet is passed, the configuration is deployed to the `development` environment for live paper trading to validate its end-to-end performance with real market data but without risking capital.

6. **Deployment:** After a successful simulation and final business sign-off, the change is merged to the `main` branch and deployed to the `production` environment.
