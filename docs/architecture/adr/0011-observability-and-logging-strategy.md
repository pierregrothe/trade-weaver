# ADR-0011: Observability and Logging Strategy

* **Status:** Proposed
* **Date:** 2025-08-04
* **Deciders:** [Your Name], AI Assistant

## Context and Problem Statement

When operating an autonomous trading system, we must have deep visibility into its behavior. If a trade is made, we need to know exactly why. If an error occurs, we need to debug it quickly. This requires a structured approach to logging, monitoring, and alerting.

## Considered Options

* **Option 1: Basic Logging:** Use simple `print()` statements or basic logging to standard output.
* **Option 2: Structured Logging with Google Cloud's Operations Suite:** Implement structured JSON logging and leverage the integrated tools within Google Cloud (Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Trace) for a comprehensive observability solution.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Option 2: Structured Logging with Google Cloud's Operations Suite".

### Positive Consequences

* **Powerful Querying:** Structured logs (JSON) are machine-readable. We can use Google Cloud Logging's powerful query language to easily search and filter logs (e.g., "show me all logs for `AnalyzerAgent` with `status=ERROR`").
* **Integrated Ecosystem:**
  * **Cloud Logging:** Centralized log aggregation for all our services (Firebase Functions, Cloud Run).
  * **Cloud Monitoring:** We can create dashboards to visualize key metrics (e.g., number of trades, API latency, error rates) and set up alerts if these metrics cross critical thresholds.
  * **Cloud Trace:** We can trace requests as they flow between our services (e.g., from the Firebase function to the Cloud Run engine), making it easy to identify performance bottlenecks.
* **Cost-Effective:** These tools are deeply integrated into Google Cloud and are very cost-effective at our initial scale.
