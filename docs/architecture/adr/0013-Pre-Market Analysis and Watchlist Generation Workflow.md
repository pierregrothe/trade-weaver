# ADR-0013: Pre-Market Analysis and Watchlist Generation Workflow

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2025-08-06
* **Deciders:** Pierre GrothÃ©, Tommy (AI Assistant)

## Context and Problem Statement

The AI Day Trading Agent requires a systematic, automated, and robust process to run before the market opens. The goal is to filter thousands of stocks across multiple exchanges down to a small, data-rich, and actionable watchlist of high-probability candidates for the day. This process must be efficient, scalable, and adhere to the strict, quantitative principles defined in the project's knowledge base.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "**Serverless Fan-Out/Fan-In Pipeline via Pub/Sub**", because this architecture provides true, scalable parallelism, which is essential for completing scans of multiple exchanges efficiently before the market opens. It aligns perfectly with our event-driven and serverless principles (ADR-0004, ADR-0012) and directly implements the modularity and hierarchical control from the knowledge base \[cite: 01\_system\_architecture\_blueprint.md\].

### Positive Consequences

* **True Parallelism & Efficiency:** Each exchange is processed by a separate, independent Cloud Run instance, drastically reducing the total time required for pre-market analysis.
* **Scalability:** Adding new markets is a simple configuration change in Firestore. Cloud Run will automatically scale the number of parallel workers to match the workload.
* **Reliability & Resilience:** Using Pub/Sub decouples the components. If a scan for one exchange fails, it can be retried without impacting the others.

### Negative Consequences

* **Increased Observability Complexity:** Debugging requires tracing a request across multiple services (Scheduler -> Pub/Sub -> Cloud Run), making structured logging (ADR-0011) essential.
* **Dependency Management:** The system is critically dependent on the availability of the EODHD API, Pub/Sub, and Firestore during the pre-market window.

### Appendix B: Agent & Service Definitions

#### Coordinator (Cloud Run Entrypoint)

* **Trigger:** Pub/Sub Topic (`start-pre-market-scan`).
* **Task:**
    1. Reads the list of exchanges to be scanned from the Firestore `exchanges` collection.
    2. For each exchange, publishes a message to the `pre-market-scan-jobs` Pub/Sub topic.
* **ADK Implementation:** This is a simple, non-agentic Python function.

#### PreMarketScannerAgent (Specialist Service)

* **Trigger:** Pub/Sub Topic (`pre-market-scan-jobs`).
* **ADK Class:** `SequentialAgent`.
* **Input:** A Pub/Sub message containing the exchange to scan (e.g., `{"exchange": "TSX"}`).
* **Task:** Execute the analysis and enrichment tools in a strict sequence for the given exchange.
* **Output:** Writes the final enriched watchlist to Firestore; terminates its Cloud Run instance.
