# ADR-0013: Pre-Market Analysis and Watchlist Generation Workflow

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2025-08-06
* **Deciders:** Pierre GrothÃ©, Tommy (AI Assistant)

## Context and Problem Statement

The AI Day Trading Agent requires a systematic, automated, and robust process to run before the market opens. The goal is to filter thousands of stocks across multiple exchanges down to a small, data-rich, and actionable watchlist of high-probability candidates for the day. This process must be efficient, scalable, and adhere to the strict, quantitative principles defined in the project's knowledge base.

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "**Serverless Fan-Out/Fan-In Pipeline via Pub/Sub**", because this architecture provides true, scalable parallelism, which is essential for completing scans of multiple exchanges efficiently before the market opens. It aligns perfectly with our event-driven and serverless principles (ADR-0004, ADR-0012) and directly implements the modularity and hierarchical control from the knowledge base \[cite: 01\_system\_architecture\_blueprint.md\].

### Positive Consequences

* **True Parallelism & Efficiency:** Each exchange is processed by a separate, independent Cloud Run instance, drastically reducing the total time required for pre-market analysis.
* **Scalability:** Adding new markets is a simple configuration change in Firestore. Cloud Run will automatically scale the number of parallel workers to match the workload.
* **Reliability & Resilience:** Using Pub/Sub decouples the components. If a scan for one exchange fails, it can be retried without impacting the others. The root `CoordinatorAgent` is designed to be resilient, yielding a final "error" status if all child pipelines fail, ensuring the system doesn't produce an empty success report.

### Negative Consequences

* **Increased Observability Complexity:** Debugging requires tracing a request across multiple services (Scheduler -> Pub/Sub -> Cloud Run), making structured logging (ADR-0011) essential.
* **Dependency Management:** The system is critically dependent on the availability of the EODHD API, Pub/Sub, and Firestore during the pre-market window.

    CoordinatorAgent->>CoordinatorAgent: 1. Receives payload `exchanges: ["NASDAQ", "TSX"]`

    CoordinatorAgent->>+ParallelAgent: 2. **(Fan-Out)** Dynamically builds ParallelAgent with two complete pipeline instances

    Note right of ParallelAgent: Both pipelines run their full internal sequence concurrently in the SAME session.

    ParallelAgent->>+MarketAnalystPipeline: 3a. NASDAQ pipeline runs: <br/> 1. Fetches Exchange Details <br/> 2. Runs Regime Analysis <br/> 3. Runs Stock Scanning <br/> 4. Assembles its result
    MarketAnalystPipeline-->>Session State: Writes its complete result to **`result_NASDAQ`**

    ParallelAgent->>+MarketAnalystPipeline: 3b. TSX pipeline runs in parallel...
    MarketAnalystPipeline-->>Session State: Writes its complete result to **`result_TSX`**

    ParallelAgent-->>-CoordinatorAgent: 4. Parallel execution completes

    CoordinatorAgent->>Session State: 5. **(Fan-In)** Reads `result_NASDAQ` and `result_TSX` objects from state

    CoordinatorAgent->>Final Report: 6. Assembles the final `DailyWatchlistDocument`

    CoordinatorAgent-->>External System: 7. Returns final, aggregated JSON report
```

### Appendix B: Agent & Service Definitions

#### CoordinatorAgent (Root Agent)

*   **ADK Class:** `BaseAgent` (custom implementation).
*   **Task:**
    1.  Receives a JSON payload with a list of exchanges.
    2.  Dynamically constructs a `ParallelAgent`.
    3.  For each exchange, it instantiates a complete `MarketAnalystPipeline` worker and adds it to the `ParallelAgent`.
    4.  Executes the `ParallelAgent`.
    5.  After completion, it "fans-in" the results from each pipeline from the session state.
    6.  Aggregates the results into a single `DailyWatchlistDocument`.
    7.  Yields a final event with the aggregated document.

#### MarketAnalystPipeline (Worker Pipeline)

*   **ADK Class:** `SequentialAgent`.
*   **Input:** An `exchange` string (e.g., "NASDAQ") passed during instantiation.
*   **Task:** Execute the full analysis for a single exchange by running a sequence of sub-pipelines and agents. This pipeline is optimized to be "deterministic-first," using custom code-driven agents for tool calls to maximize efficiency and reliability.
*   **Internal Structure:**
    1.  **`SetExchangeParamAgent` (`BaseAgent`):** Sets the initial `exchange` parameter in the state.
    2.  **`CustomToolCallingAgent` (`BaseAgent`):** Deterministically calls the `get_exchange_details` tool.
    3.  **`MarketRegimeSubPipeline` (`SequentialAgent`):**
        *   Runs a `ParallelAgent` containing multiple `CustomToolCallingAgent`s to gather VIX, ADX, and time data deterministically.
        *   Runs a single `LlmAgent` to synthesize the gathered data into a `MarketRegimeState`.
    4.  **`StockScannerSubPipeline` (`SequentialAgent`):**
        *   Runs the `StockDataEnrichmentAgent` (`BaseAgent`) to deterministically execute the multi-step tool-calling logic for finding and enriching stock data.
        *   Runs a single `LlmAgent` to synthesize the enriched data into a `StockCandidateList`.
    5.  **`FinalResultAssemblerAgent` (`BaseAgent`):** Deterministically assembles the final `ExchangeAnalysisResult` from the outputs of the sub-pipelines.
*   **Output:** Writes a single, complete `ExchangeAnalysisResult` object to a unique key in the session state (e.g., `result_NASDAQ`).
