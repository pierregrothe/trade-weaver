# **ADR-001: Pre-Market Analysis and Watchlist Generation Workflow**

* **Status:** Accepted  
* **Date:** 2025-08-06  
* **Deciders:** Pierre Groth√©, Tommy (AI Assistant)

## **Context and Problem Statement**

The AI Day Trading Agent requires a systematic, automated, and robust process to run before the market opens. The goal is to filter thousands of stocks across multiple exchanges down to a small, data-rich, and actionable watchlist of high-probability candidates for the day. This process must be efficient, scalable, and adhere to the strict, quantitative principles defined in the project's knowledge base.

## **Decision Outcome**

**Chosen option:** "**Parallelized, Multi-Agent Sequential Pipeline**", because it is the most robust, scalable, and efficient architecture that directly implements the principles of modularity and hierarchical control from the knowledge base \[cite: 01\_system\_architecture\_blueprint.md\]. This design guarantees that the rigorous, multi-stage analysis is performed deterministically for each exchange, while leveraging parallel processing to ensure the final watchlist is ready well before the market opens.

### **Positive Consequences**

* **Efficiency:** Scanning multiple exchanges in parallel drastically reduces the overall time required for pre-market analysis.  
* **Scalability:** Adding a new market to the daily scan is a simple configuration change in Firestore, with no changes required to the agent's code.  
* **Reliability & Testability:** The use of a SequentialAgent for the core pipeline ensures every step is executed in the correct order. Each FunctionTool can be unit-tested in isolation.

### **Negative Consequences**

* **Initial Complexity:** The setup requires defining a hierarchy of agents and multiple, distinct tools.  
* **Dependency Management:** The system is critically dependent on the availability of the EODHD API and the Firestore database during the pre-market window.

### **Appendix B: Agent & Tool Definitions**

#### **TradingDeskCoordinator (Orchestrator)**

* **ADK Class:** ParallelAgent  
* **Input:** JSON payload from Cloud Scheduler (e.g., {"task": "run\_pre\_market\_scan", "exchanges": \["TSX", "NASDAQ"\]}).  
* **Task:** For each exchange in the exchanges array, invoke the PreMarketScannerAgent as a parallel sub-agent.  
* **Output:** An aggregated success/failure message after all parallel scans are complete.

#### **PreMarketScannerAgent (Specialist Sub-Agent)**

* **ADK Class:** SequentialAgent  
* **Input:** An exchange symbol (e.g., "TSX").  
* **Task:** Execute the analysis and enrichment tools in a strict sequence.  
* **Output:** Writes the final enriched watchlist to Firestore; returns a status dict to the Coordinator.

### **Appendix C: Detailed Data Schemas**

#### **Daily Watchlist Document (Firestore)**

*This is the schema for the single document created for each pre-market run. The Document ID could be the date, e.g., 2025-08-06.*
