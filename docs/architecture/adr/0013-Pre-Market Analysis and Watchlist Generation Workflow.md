# ADR-0013: Pre-Market Analysis and Watchlist Generation Workflow

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2025-08-06
* **Deciders:** Pierre GrothÃ©, Tommy (AI Assistant)

## 1. Context and Problem Statement

The AI Day Trading Agent requires a systematic, automated, and robust process to run during the **Pre-Market** state (7:00 - 9:30 ET) as defined in `01_daily_routine_and_cadence.md`. The goal is to execute a multi-stage data processing pipeline that filters thousands of stocks across multiple exchanges down to a small, data-rich, and actionable watchlist of high-probability candidates. This process must be efficient, scalable, and adhere to the strict, quantitative principles for identifying "stocks in play" detailed in `02_pre_market_scanning_and_watchlist.md`. The final output must be a structured, machine-readable object ready for the trade execution and selection modules.

## 2. Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "**Serverless Fan-Out/Fan-In Pipeline via Pub/Sub**", because this architecture provides true, scalable parallelism, which is essential for completing scans of multiple exchanges efficiently before the market opens. It aligns perfectly with our event-driven and serverless principles defined in `01_system_architecture_blueprint.md` and directly implements the modularity and hierarchical control required. This architecture is the most resilient and efficient way to execute the multi-stage filtering and analysis pipeline.

### Positive Consequences

* **True Parallelism & Efficiency:** Each exchange is processed by a separate, independent Cloud Run instance, drastically reducing the total time required for pre-market analysis.
* **Scalability:** Adding new markets is a simple configuration change in Firestore. Cloud Run will automatically scale the number of parallel workers to match the workload.
* **Reliability & Resilience:** Using Pub/Sub decouples the components. If a scan for one exchange fails, it can be retried without impacting the others. The root `CoordinatorAgent` is designed to be resilient, yielding a final "error" status if all child pipelines fail, ensuring the system doesn't produce an empty success report.

### Negative Consequences

* **Increased Observability Complexity:** Debugging requires tracing a request across multiple services (Scheduler -> Pub/Sub -> Cloud Run), making structured logging essential.
* **Dependency Management:** The system is critically dependent on the availability of the EODHD API, Pub/Sub, and Firestore during the pre-market window.

## 3. Detailed Algorithmic Workflow & Agent Definitions

The pre-market workflow is a sequential pipeline executed by the `MarketAnalystPipeline` for each target exchange. The root `CoordinatorAgent` orchestrates this process in parallel across all exchanges.

    CoordinatorAgent->>CoordinatorAgent: 1. Receives payload `exchanges: ["NASDAQ", "TSX"]`

    CoordinatorAgent->>+ParallelAgent: 2. **(Fan-Out)** Dynamically builds ParallelAgent with two complete pipeline instances

    Note right of ParallelAgent: Both pipelines run their full internal sequence concurrently in the SAME session.

    ParallelAgent->>+MarketAnalystPipeline: 3a. NASDAQ pipeline runs: <br/> 1. Fetches Exchange Details <br/> 2. Runs Regime Analysis <br/> 3. Runs Stock Scanning <br/> 4. Assembles its result
    MarketAnalystPipeline-->>Session State: Writes its complete result to **`result_NASDAQ`**

    ParallelAgent->>+MarketAnalystPipeline: 3b. TSX pipeline runs in parallel...
    MarketAnalystPipeline-->>Session State: Writes its complete result to **`result_TSX`**

    ParallelAgent-->>-CoordinatorAgent: 4. Parallel execution completes

    CoordinatorAgent->>Session State: 5. **(Fan-In)** Reads `result_NASDAQ` and `result_TSX` objects from state

    CoordinatorAgent->>Final Report: 6. Assembles the final `DailyWatchlistDocument`

    CoordinatorAgent-->>External System: 7. Returns final, aggregated JSON report
```

### Appendix B: Agent & Service Definitions

#### CoordinatorAgent (Root Agent)

* **ADK Class:** `BaseAgent` (custom implementation).
* **Task:**
    1. Receives a JSON payload with a list of exchanges.
    2. Dynamically constructs a `ParallelAgent`.
    3. For each exchange, it instantiates a complete `MarketAnalystPipeline` worker and adds it to the `ParallelAgent`.
    4. Executes the `ParallelAgent`.
    5. After completion, it "fans-in" the results from each pipeline from the session state.
    6. Aggregates the results into a single `DailyWatchlistDocument`.
    7. Yields a final event with the aggregated document.

#### MarketAnalystPipeline (Worker Pipeline)

* **ADK Class:** `SequentialAgent`.
* **Input:** An `exchange` string (e.g., "NASDAQ") passed during instantiation.
* **Task:** Execute the full analysis for a single exchange. This pipeline is optimized to be "deterministic-first," using custom code-driven agents for tool calls to maximize efficiency and reliability.
* **Internal Structure & Algorithmic Steps:**

    1. **`SetExchangeParamAgent` (`BaseAgent`):** Sets the initial `exchange` parameter in the state.
    2. **`MarketRegimeSubPipeline` (`SequentialAgent`):** This sub-pipeline establishes the broad market context before any stock-specific analysis.
        * Runs a `ParallelAgent` containing multiple `CustomToolCallingAgent`s to gather:
            * **VIX Value:** For market volatility state (`Low`, `Medium`, `High`). [cite: 05\_market\_regime\_analysis\_module.md]
            * **ADX Value:** For market trend state (`Ranging`, `Trending`). [cite: 05\_market\_regime\_analysis\_module.md]
            * **Time of Day:** To determine the market phase (`Pre-Market`). [cite: 01\_daily\_routine\_and\_cadence.md]
        * Runs a single `LlmAgent` to synthesize the gathered data into a `MarketRegimeState` object and store it in the session state.

    3. **`StockScannerSubPipeline` (`SequentialAgent`):** This is the core filtering and enrichment pipeline.
        * **Stage 1: Static Universe Filtering (`BaseAgent`):** Executes a tool that filters all stocks on the exchange based on the following rules from `02_pre_market_scanning_and_watchlist.md`:
            * `Average Daily Volume (90-day) > 1,000,000 shares`
            * `Last Closing Price > $5.00 AND Last Closing Price < $200.00`
            * `Average True Range (ATR, 14-day) > $0.50`
        * **Stage 2: Dynamic Gapper Scanning (`BaseAgent`):** Executes a tool against the "Tradable Universe" to identify gappers based on:
            * `Gap Percentage >= 2.0%`
            * `Pre-Market Volume >= 100,000 shares` (by 9:00 AM ET)
            * **Relative Volume (RVOL) > 1000% (10x)** of its 30-day historical average for the same time of day. [cite: 02\_pre\_market\_scanning\_and\_watchlist.md]
        * **Stage 3: Catalyst Identification and Scoring (`BaseAgent`):** For each identified gapper, this agent runs an NLP pipeline tool as defined in `02_pre_market_scanning_and_watchlist.md`:
            * Queries a news API for headlines in the last 18 hours.
            * Classifies news using a FinBERT model (`Earnings Beat`, `M&A Offer`, `FDA Approval`).
            * Assigns a quantitative `Catalyst_Score` (1-10) and populates the `catalyst_details` field in the `StockCandidateObject`.
        * **Stage 4: Final Ranking & Filtering (`LlmAgent`):** This agent synthesizes all the data for the gappers.
            * It calculates a final `Ranking_Score` using the weighted formula: `(Catalyst_Score * 0.40) + (RVOL_Score * 0.30) + (Gap_Score * 0.15) + (Chart_Clarity_Score * 0.15)`. [cite: 02\_pre\_market\_scanning\_and\_watchlist.md]
            * It performs a final risk filter as per `05_advanced_trade_selection_algorithm.md`, discarding any candidate where:
                * `ATR (14-day) > 5% of Current_Price`
                * `Average Dollar Volume (30-day) < $20,000,000`
            * The output is a ranked list of enriched `StockCandidateObject`s, which is stored in the session state as a `StockCandidateList`.

    4. **`FinalResultAssemblerAgent` (`BaseAgent`):** Deterministically assembles the final `ExchangeAnalysisResult` from the `MarketRegimeState` and `StockCandidateList` in the session state.
* **Output:** Writes a single, complete `ExchangeAnalysisResult` object to a unique key in the session state (e.g., `result_NASDAQ`).
