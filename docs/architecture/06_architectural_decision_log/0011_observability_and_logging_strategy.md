# ADR-011: Observability and Logging Strategy

* **Status:** Proposed

## Context and Problem Statement

When operating an autonomous trading system, having deep visibility into its real-time behavior is non-negotiable. If a trade is made, we need a clear, auditable trail of the agent's reasoning. If an error occurs, we need to be able to debug it quickly and efficiently. This requires a professional approach to logging, monitoring, and alerting.

## Considered Options

* **Option 1: Basic Logging:** Use simple `print()` statements or basic text logging to standard output. This is simple but makes searching, filtering, and alerting nearly impossible in a cloud environment.
* **Option 2: Structured Logging with Google Cloud's Operations Suite:** Implement structured JSON logging throughout the application and leverage the integrated tools within Google Cloud (Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Trace).

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option:** "Option 2: Structured Logging with Google Cloud's Operations Suite".

### Positive Consequences

* **Powerful Querying:** By logging in a structured JSON format, we can use Google Cloud Logging's powerful query language to instantly search and filter logs (e.g., "show me all logs for `AnalyzerAgent` with `status=ERROR` for `portfolioId=XYZ`").
* **Integrated Monitoring:** We can create dashboards in Cloud Monitoring to visualize key metrics (e.g., number of trades per hour, broker API latency, error rates) and set up alerts to notify us if these metrics cross critical thresholds.
* **Performance Tracing:** Cloud Trace will allow us to follow requests as they flow between our services (e.g., from the Firebase function trigger to the Cloud Run engine), making it easy to identify performance bottlenecks.
* **Native Integration:** This solution is built into our chosen cloud platform, making it easy to implement and cost-effective at our scale.
