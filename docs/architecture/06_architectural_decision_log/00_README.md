# Architectural Decision Log (ADL)

This directory contains the Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Trade Weaver project. An ADR is a short, immutable document that captures a significant architectural decision, its context, and its consequences.

## Purpose

The purpose of this log is to provide a clear historical record of key architectural choices. This helps current and future team members understand:

- **Why** certain decisions were made.
- What **alternatives** were considered.
- The **consequences** and trade-offs of the chosen path.

Each ADR is numbered sequentially and has a status (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Superseded). While the canonical, up-to-date documentation resides in the parent architectural domains (e.g., `03_application_architecture`), these records provide the essential background and rationale behind that architecture.
