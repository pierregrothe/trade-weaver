# Trade Weaver Architecture Repository

This repository contains the official architectural documentation for the Trade Weaver platform. It is organized using a framework inspired by **TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework)** to ensure a clear, comprehensive, and maintainable structure.

The architecture is broken down into five core domains, each housed in its own directory:

- **`01_business_architecture/`**: The "Why." Documents the business goals, vision, and value streams that drive the technical architecture.
- **`02_data_architecture/`**: The "What." Describes the structure, flow, and management of data throughout the system.
- **`03_application_architecture/`**: The "How." Details the software components, their interactions, interface contracts, and the agent-specific frameworks.
- **`04_technology_architecture/`**: The "Where." Defines the underlying infrastructure, platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and operational environment.
- **`05_security_architecture/`**: The "Securely." Outlines the controls, models, and processes that protect the system, its data, and its users.

Additionally, the `06_architectural_decision_log/` contains the historical Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) that provide the context and rationale for key decisions made throughout the project's lifecycle.
