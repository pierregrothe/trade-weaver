# Observability and Logging Strategy

This document defines the strategy for logging, monitoring, and tracing for the Trade Weaver platform, as decided in ADR-0011. Deep visibility into the system's real-time behavior is a non-negotiable requirement for operating an autonomous trading system.

## 1. Core Strategy: Structured Logging

The core of the strategy is the implementation of **structured JSON logging** throughout the entire application stack. This approach enables powerful querying, automated monitoring, and effective alerting.

## 2. Technology Stack: Google Cloud's Operations Suite

We will leverage the integrated, native tools within the Google Cloud ecosystem:

- **[Logging] Google Cloud Logging (formerly Stackdriver):** All services, including the Cloud Run agents and Cloud Functions, will be configured to output logs as structured JSON. This enables powerful, real-time querying and analysis.
  - *Example Query:* `resource.type="cloud_run_revision" AND jsonPayload.agentName="MarketAnalystAgent" AND jsonPayload.status="ERROR"`

- **[Monitoring] Google Cloud Monitoring:** We will create custom dashboards in Cloud Monitoring to visualize key operational and business metrics, such as:
  - Broker API latency.
  - Pub/Sub message queue depth.
  - Agent error rates.
  - Number of trades executed per hour.

- **[Alerting] Google Cloud Alerting:** Alerts will be configured based on the metrics in Cloud Monitoring. For example, an alert will be sent to the human operator if the agent error rate exceeds a defined threshold or if a broker API becomes unresponsive.

- **[Tracing] Google Cloud Trace:** Cloud Trace will be used to follow requests as they flow between services (e.g., from the initial Cloud Scheduler trigger, to the Pub/Sub message, to the Cloud Run agent). This is critical for identifying and debugging performance bottlenecks in the distributed system.

This integrated, cloud-native approach provides a powerful, scalable, and cost-effective solution for ensuring the system is fully observable.
